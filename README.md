# AI-Driven Data Orchestration

Explorations into using AI agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build intelligent, secure, and low-code data orchestration systems.

This repository documents:
- AI-generated DAGs
- Schema-aware agents
- Metadata-driven pipelines
- Guardrails for LLMs in data systems
- Secure AI integrations

The goal is not hype, but **practical AI for data platforms**.
